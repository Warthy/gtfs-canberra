### A. The Depth Search First algorithm (DFS)
- **1** cf. code
- **2** cf. code
- **3** 
  
The order of the nodes encountered is the following: 5, 4, 2, 1, 0, 3, 7, 6
This graph has only one connected components as all nodes are linked between another, 
therefore the graph is connected.

### B. Breadth Search First algorithm (BFS)
- **1** cf. code
- **2** 

The order of the nodes encountered is the following: 5, 4, 6, 7, 2, 1, 3, 0
This graph has only one connected components as all nodes are linked between another,
therefore the graph is connected.


### C. Breadth Search First (BFS) for shortest paths in unweighted (di)graphs
- **1** cf. code
- **2** cf. code
- **3** cf. code
- **4** cf. code
- **5** cf. code
- **6**
Eccentricity of each node:
   - 0: 5
   - 1: Infinite
   - 2: Infinite
   - 3: Infinite
   - 4: Infinite
   - 5: Infinite
   - 6: Infinite
   - 7: Infinite 
 
As only node 0 is not reachable by any other nodes, it implies that all other node will
have an infinite eccentricity.
The diameter of the graph is 5 and is given by the shortest path from 0-6.
The radius is 6.
